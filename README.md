# Aries Traceability - API/Controller

This repository is a traction controller implementing the [w3c-ccg Traceability specification draft](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/traceability-interop/draft/). It leverages the [Aries Cloud Agent Python (ACAPy)](https://github.com/hyperledger/aries-cloudagent-python) where applicable, adding the core traceability functionalities.

`aries-traceability-controller` was developed as part of the Energy and Mines Digital Trust project for BC Gov. It aims to establish interoperability between the BC Gov Traction platform and the W3C Traceability specification. To get an overview of these features, please read this [Traceability and Traction feature comparison](./TraceabilityAndTractionFeatureComparison.md) document.
